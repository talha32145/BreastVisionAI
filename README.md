# 🩺 BreastVision AI  

> Early breast cancer detection made accessible, reliable, and AI-powered.  
> Built with Machine Learning, Streamlit, and Generative AI to predict whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant** with 97% accuracy.  

---

## 📌 Inspiration  
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death in women worldwide. Early detection is key to saving lives, and technology can play a vital role in making screening more accessible.  

---

## ⚡ What it does  
- 🗣 **Chatbot Mode** – Patients or doctors can enter 30 diagnostic features step by step.  
- 📷 **X-ray Analysis** – Upload mammogram images and get AI-based benign/malignant predictions.  
- 📊 **Evaluation Dashboard** – View accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix & classification report.  

---

## 🛠 How we built it  
- **Python** for data preprocessing & ML model development.  
- **Scikit-learn (LinearSVC)** for breast cancer classification.  
- **Pandas & NumPy** for dataset handling.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualizations.  
- **Streamlit** for interactive user interface.  
- **Google Gemini AI** for X-ray image analysis.  

---

## 🚧 Challenges we ran into  
- Handling 30 feature inputs in a user-friendly way.  
- Integrating image-based AI analysis with structured ML predictions.  
- Balancing model accuracy with interpretability.  

---

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we’re proud of  
- Achieved **97.64% accuracy** with LinearSVC.  
- Built an **interactive Streamlit app** combining structured data & image inputs.  
- Delivered an accessible, explainable AI tool for healthcare.  

---

## 📚 What we learned  
- The importance of **user experience (UX)** in healthcare AI tools.  
- How to combine **ML models with Generative AI** for multi-modal predictions.  
- The challenges of balancing accuracy, speed, and usability.
